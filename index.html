*Stock Price Prediction International Journal for Research in Applied Science & Engineering Technology
Stock market price prediction relies on machine learning models such as Linear Regression, LSTM, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Linear Regression captures linear relationships, making it useful for straightforward predictions. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, excels at modeling time-based dependencies, crucial for understanding trends. Random Forest, with its ensemble approach, offers robustness against overfitting and noise. KNN predicts based on the closest historical data points, useful for identifying patterns in smaller datasets
